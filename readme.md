Who's the Cone? ⚠️
"Who's the Cone?" is a gamified ranking platform built for a specific group of 4 friends (Maor, Alko, Becker, Regev) to track their gaming performance on PS5.

The system allows users to create gaming sessions, join them via a "Kahoot-style" lobby, and vote on player performance using a drag-and-drop interface. The lowest-ranked player is designated the "Cone" (⚠️), and the highest is the "King" (👑).

🧠 Core Logic & Features
1. The Squad (Hardcoded Data)

Players: Maor, Alko, Becker, Regev.

Games: FIFA, Rainbow 6 Siege, PUBG, Call Of Duty, Battlefield.

2. Session Logic

Creation: A host selects a Game and checks off which Players participated.

State: A session is created in the DB and appears in the "Active Sessions" list on the homepage.

Participation: Only players marked as participants in the creation step appear in the voting list.

3. Voting System

Flow: Users click "Join" on a session -> Select their identity ("Who are you?") -> Drag and drop players to rank them.

Ranking:

Top (First Item): King 👑

Bottom (Last Item): Cone ⚠️

Scoring Formula: Points are assigned based on rank index.

If 4 players participate: 1st place = 4 pts, 4th place = 1 pt.

Score = Total_Participants - Rank_Index

4. Database Schema

Player: id, name

Game: id, name

Session: id, date, game_id, is_active. Has a Many-to-Many relationship with Player (via session_participants table).

Vote: id, session_id, voter_id, target_player_id, rank_score.

🚀 Current Status & Roadmap
Current State:

✅ Basic CRUD for Sessions.

✅ Multi-user voting interface working.

✅ Leaderboard calculates total points.

✅ Admin can delete sessions.

Future Goals (For AI Agent Reference):

Authentication: Prevent users from voting as someone else (currently trust-based).

Advanced Stats: "Cone Counter" (how many times a player ranked last), "King Counter", and per-game stats (e.g., "Best at FIFA").

Mobile Optimization: Refine the drag-and-drop UI for smaller screens.

Session Closing: Ability to "Close" a vote so no more votes can be submitted.
